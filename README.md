ʚଓ/ DNC for skins, Please because i made the clothes with my own imagination (im trying my best 😭🫶) 

ʚଓ/ C+H is okay

ʚଓ/ Interact with will be amazing

ʚଓ/ But remember, if you already have becoming my friends, you must be honest about something and told me if you overwhelmed by me so we're not misunderstanding each other and hurt one person's feeling

ʚଓ/ Feel free to talk about your mood to me, i'll listen and do my best to give advice if you needed to. 

ʚଓ/ Don't be shy around me, you can be yourself. I respect all things you do as long as you're not making people around feel uncomfortable

ʚଓ/ Feel awkward? don't worry, im not forcing you to interact. You can just leave and have fun ^^ !
